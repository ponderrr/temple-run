## 📖 About

**Temple Run Arcade 3D** is a specialized engine implementation of the classic endless runner genre, re-engineered for **deterministic arcade compliance**. unlike traditional physics-based runners, this engine utilizes a discrete state machine and lane-based coordinate system to ensure pixel-perfect collision detection and zero-latency input response.

Built for developers who need to understand **game loop architecture** and **procedural generation** without the overhead of heavy commercial engines.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Deterministic State Machine** — Uses discrete integer-based lane logic (0, 1, 2) rather than floating-point physics to guarantee predictable outcomes.
*   **Zero-Allocation Pooling** — Custom `ObstacleSpawner` utilizes object pooling principles to minimize garbage collection spikes during high-speed runtime.
*   **Procedural Track Generation** — Infinite world generation using efficient chunk recycling and dynamic difficulty scaling.
*   **Reactive Event Bus** — Decoupled `CollisionDetector`, `ScoreManager`, and `VFXManager` systems communicating via direct state interrogation.
*   **Hot-Reloadable Config** — Centralized configuration management for rapid gameplay tuning without recompilation.

## 🏗 Architecture

### System Design
The engine follows a strict separation of concerns, decoupling the **Game Loop** from **Entity Logic**.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Main Loop] -->|Delta Time| B[Game Managers]
    B --> C[Spawning System]
    B --> D[Collision System]
    B --> E[Camera System]
    
    C -->|Instantiate| F[Entities]
    F -->|Position Data| D
    D -->|Hit Events| G[Score/GameState]

    D
    E
    end
    
    subgraph Data Layer

    G
    end
```

### Component Interaction
Entities are data-driven wrappers around Ursina Visuals, controlled by external systems.

```mermaid

    participant Input
    participant Player
    participant CollisionSystem
    participant GameState
    
    Input->>Player: Lane Switch (Left/Right)
    Player->>Player: Update Lane Index (Int)
    Player->>Player: Tween Visual Position
    
    loop Every Frame
        CollisionSystem->>Player: Get Lane & Depth
        CollisionSystem->>Obstacles: Check Lane Match
        
        alt Collision Detected
            CollisionSystem->>GameState: Trigger Game Over
            GameState->>Input: Disable Controls
        end
    end
```

## 📚 Documentation & Examples

### Lane Logic Implementation
The core mechanic relies on integer-based positioning to prevent "floaty" movement.

```python
# entities/player.py

def switch_lane(self, direction):
    """
    Deterministic lane switching with boundary checks.
    Args:
        direction (int): -1 for Left, 1 for Right
    """
    new_lane = self.lane + direction
    
    # Boundary Check (Lanes 0, 1, 2)
    if 0 <= new_lane <= 2:
        self.lane = new_lane
        # Trigger visual tween (does not affect logical position)
        self.animate_x(self.lane_positions[self.lane], duration=0.2)
```

### Collision Detection
Collisions are calculated mathematically, not via physics engine raycasts, ensuring 100% reliability.

```python
# systems/collision.py

def check_collision(self, player, obstacles):
    for obs in obstacles:
        # 1. Lane Filter (Logical)
        if obs.lane != player.lane:
            continue
            
        # 2. Depth Check (Math)
        distance = abs(player.z - obs.z)
        if distance < self.COLLISION_THRESHOLD:
            return True, obs
    return False, None
```
